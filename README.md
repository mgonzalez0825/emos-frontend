The purpose in developing EMOS application was to provide a digital solution that addresses the issue of having to deal with multiple databases, either physical or logical, in the process of managing employees within an organization . EMOS defines a unique MySQL database that stores all data related to employees and makes sorting , querying ,insertion and deletion to the database an easy task due to the form data is organized and related within the MySQL EMOS relational schema. The application will also give the user the ability to easily add and remove departments, jobs and employees within the organization. In addition, the client can assign employees to a supervisor or not supervisor role and manage their work schedules. image

Employee management system Capstone Project

Methodology Use of IEEE Standard for Information Technology 2009 Edition to complete the Software Design Specification document. Using Relational Database Management System MySQL to easily manage organization information regarding employees. Use of Spring Boot Framework to build a standalone enterprise-level EMOS application and connect to EMOS database. Use of Hibernate Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java and its java standard Java Persistence API(JPA) to simplify the process of mapping Java objects to relational database tables and vice versa. Use of MySQL workbench Use React JS library to build user interface in JavaScript. Use of Bootstrap framework as React dependency to build responsive UIs. Use of Spring Security to provide comprehensive authentication , authorization and protection to EMOS application. Use of Spring Security built-in support for JSON Web Token JWT-based authentication and authorization. image

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
